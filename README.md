This project was used for a coding challenge for an application to an programming position at BYU OIT. 
The structures and idea for how to create this were soley my own and all code is original, though I did use AI to help me with simple syntactical problems (like Capitalize vs. Capitalize() and end='').
I missed the portion about no AI until I was on my final comb-through of the project specifications, but the AI was used for small syntax things that could have easily accessed on other non-AI websites. 
I had to think about how I wanted to implement this project, and decided to create a list and iterate through it, updating it as I went through the word to guess. The easiest way to keep track
of the letters was through a dictionary which I implimented. Overall this project took me just over an hour of focused time and another 15-30 minutes of slightly distracted time (I have a 2 month old baby). 
This project was really fun for me and I enjoyed envisioning how this would go, creating the structures, and working through the small bugs I had to ensure I got a working finished product!
